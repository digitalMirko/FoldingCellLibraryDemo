# FoldingCell Library Demo app

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'FoldingCell Library Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a colored cell block with the text 'First Line Text' positioned inside of it. 
As the user clicks it. The colored cell block flips out labeled 'Second Line Text'. 
Then a third cell block flips out labeled 'Third Line Text'. 
Followed by a fourth cell block with a button that is labeled 'Fourth Line Button'. 
If the user clicks the button it clicks but no action is assigned to it. 
Then when the user clicks any of the colored cell blocks it folds back up to a single block labeled 'First Line Text'.
